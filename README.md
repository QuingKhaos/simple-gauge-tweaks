# Simple Gauge Tweaks

Opinionated tweaks to [Simple Gauge](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/simple-gauge).
For a full list of changes, take a look at the changelog.

If you want to see some new tweaks, feel free to open a discussion thread on the
mod portal or a GitHub issue. Eventually some non so opinionated tweaks will
make it into the original mod.
